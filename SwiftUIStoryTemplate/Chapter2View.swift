Every day, at sunrise and sunset they will sit together, have breakfast, dinner and occasionally have lunch together. Their time together was always filled with tales of their day, lots of hearty loud laughs, great conversation and at the centre of it all, a nicely brewed tea pot shared in fancy tea mugs.")
